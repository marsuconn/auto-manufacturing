# Auto-Manufac

Automating manufacturing processes using **Operations Research (OR)** and **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** techniques.

## Overview

Auto-Manufac applies hybrid OR+RL methods to optimize key manufacturing operations:

- **Scheduling** — Job/machine scheduling optimization (e.g., flow shop, job shop)
- **Routing** — Material and product flow routing through manufacturing stages
- **Queuing** — Queue management and prioritization at workstations/resources

The goal is to learn adaptive policies that outperform traditional heuristics in dynamic manufacturing environments.
